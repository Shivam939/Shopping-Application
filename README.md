## 🧱 Application Architecture

This application follows a **Domain-Driven, Microservices-based Architecture**:

- Each service is independently deployable and scalable  
- Communication between services uses **Kafka** and **REST APIs**  
- **Keycloak** secures APIs with role-based access  
- **API Gateway** handles routing, token validation, and acts as a single-entry point  
- Monitoring and logging are centralized using the **Grafana stack**  
- Integration testing supported via **TestContainers** and **WireMock**
